The purpose of this is to see how many bees there are currently, how many have been lost and why they were lost. The main goal of this is to understand the biggest factors of lost honeybee colonies.

Using machine learning, we can understand the impact of certain factors of honeybee deaths including varroa mites, diseases and pesticides. Applying linear regression, we can make predictions for the future.
Please note this data is only from the years between 2015 and 2022.
